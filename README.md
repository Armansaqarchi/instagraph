## About the project
<div align="left">
This project aims to give an intuition of how the database schemas and apis might look for designing a social media application.
though for the sake of simplicity, its based on DRF architecture which is more supported and easier to develop.
<br>
<br>
as you might know, popular social medias like instagram and facebook are now using an architecture called graphql.
the problem with this architecture is having complexity of query.
parsing the query and extracting the semantics might be time consuming,
while its wide types of queries could lead to making complex queries much easier than DRF
